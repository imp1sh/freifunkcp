[beta 0.61]
2015-12-11
- optimized documentation, though still far from perfect
- fix in create_uci.bash, some of the releases prior to this were lacking a functional script
- renaming of some template files
- general optimizations
- 1st video online https://youtu.be/ZM6lvoHKqeU
- reworks on how the scripts interact and where files reside that are being sources
- reworks on scripts in general - trying to give it a clearer structure - WIP
- reworks on how to include ssh keys -> own configuration 
- added ula_global for non-global parameter in guest or lan - does this really make sense ?
- configure some more general configuration parameters within ffcp_parameter.conf

[beta 0.6]
- changed from managing different devices and installation via branch system to managing devices and installation via create_uci.bash script
- based upon this also documentation needed fixing
- this is the first release that publishes binary images at http://images.gosix.net

[beta 0.52]
- since Chaos Calmer 15.05 is now stable we switched to it which affects only documentation actually
- slowly getting back to normal. As normal is trying to figure out what the best method is to manage build process and to maintain all those different branches

[beta 0.51]
- as it turned out I was chasing a problem that was caused by openwrt trunk moving to musl-libc. Thanks a lot to NeoRaider who fixed this in batman-adv-legacy in https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/packages

[beta 0.5]
- about at when gluon 2015.1 came out everything kind of breaks down... bigger problem of integrating batman-adv legacy seamlessly without a hassle
- also problems of embedding gluon packages as when I invoke './scripts/feeds update -a'
- drew graph in docs so build process is better understandable
- effort of embedding gluon packages by replacing Makefile options especially Inludes of package.mk
- version does not build currently, we'll continoue with 0.5.1 when building works ok again

[beta 0.42]

[beta 0.41]

- publishing as freifunkcp at github
- moved from batmn-adv to batman-adv-legacy https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/batman-adv-legacy
- integration of gluon packages
- update to CC trunk af7e37dfff6b3afa22a052cee7acb4d2cf5f43fe
- thus also upgrade to kernel 3.14.32 -> 3.18.10
- freifunk map integration - work in progress - 99 %
- remake of motd

[beta 0.4]
February 2015 Jochen Demmer
- switch from own collision domain for guests into bridged setup
- setting fixed interface names appriv and appub like with adhoc0
- updated to openwrt commit 02b2a9b82d727f1b50e59fb56cdf40264f5eff9a Chaos Calmer r44362 kernel 3.14.32
- integrated quagga with OSPF
- switched to new freifunk aachen domain with local supernode and new SSID/BSSID/Channel 11 instead of 3
- bridged tagged switch port vlan 11 into br-mesh instead of adding ethx.11 to bat0 directly
- slightly changed banner


[beta 0.31]
January 2015 Jochen Demmer
- created branch system to handle multiple environments easier

[beta 0.2]
 January 2015 Jochen Demmer
- Fully compatible to Freifunk Aachen
- bridged setup similar to Freifunk gluon (thanks to good support to @Freifunk)
- difference for example that local guests are not bridged into bat0
- no own fastd vpn ability supernodes
- sophisticated vlan configuration for broad variety of home setups
- bat0 not only for wireless but also wired out of the box
- no map integration at all so far (planned)
- batman-adv bonding and bridge_loop_avoidance both enabled
- basic firewall ground rules (hopefully no holes so far)
- alfred built-in and activated but not really configured, yet
- 5 GHz for private only
- 2,4 GHz for guests and spine
- generated ula for guests based upon adhoc0 MAC address
