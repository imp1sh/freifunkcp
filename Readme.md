Full featured OpenWrt that's compatible to Freifunk (batman-adv).
freifunkcp stands for FreifunkComPatible

## What is this?
This is an effort to develop a full featured OpenWrt firmware that has builtin Freifunk compatibility, while meaning batman-adv Freifunk.

## Why is this?
Freifunk aims differently than us. Freifunk offers free wifi to the people, but mainly to gain access to the Internet. Our goal is to built a network that exists parallely to your private LAN and to the public Internet. This network should be utilized to give the users the possibility to communicate directly with each other via this metropolitan area network (MAN). There are quite a lot of details which we try to improvise in order to make everything easier accessible and better usable.

## How to use this?
Please take a look into the doc directory for further information.
