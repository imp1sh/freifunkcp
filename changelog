[beta 0.2]
 January 2015 Jochen Demmer
- Fully compatible to Freifunk Aachen
- bridged setup similar to Freifunk gluon (thanks to good support to @Freifunk)
- difference for example that local guests are not bridged into bat0
- no own fastd vpn ability supernodes
- sophisticated vlan configuration for broad variety of home setups
- bat0 not only for wireless but also wired out of the box
- no map integration at all so far (planned)
- batman-adv bonding and bridge_loop_avoidance both enabled
- basic firewall ground rules (hopefully no holes so far)
- alfred built-in and activated but not really configured, yet
- 5 GHz for private only
- 2,4 GHz for guests and spine
- generated ula for guests based upon adhoc0 MAC address
