there are two main directories:
1. where you checkout openwrt, we actually use freifuncp as the directory name here
2. where you checkout freifunkcp sources, we use env as directory name while it is a subdirectory of freifunkcp.

./freifunkcp/ referred to as buildroot directory
./freifunkcp/env/ referred to as freifunkcp directory

git clone git://git.openwrt.org/openwrt.git

prepare your system to be able to use openwrt buildroot env.

   clone openwrt and update and install feeds:
#####
git clone git://git.openwrt.org/openwrt.git freifunkcp
cd freifunkcp
./scripts/feeds update -a
./scripts/feeds install -a
#download version patch and apply
#####


#checkout environment from github and link .config and files/ to it (i guess this is done by ./scripts/env new, but it should be fine to just link them, since we place a remote repository to env)
#and apply patch from env/patches/version.patch
#this replaces the source of the batman-adv package, with one i checked out from https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/batman-adv-legacy, this is the 2013.4.0 with patches for freifunk (if i understood correctly), so we can use the actual master branch and not an old commit of openwrt
#####
git clone https://github.com/imp1sh/freifunkcp.git env
ln -sf env/.config
ln -sf env/files
patch -p1 < env/patches/version.patch
